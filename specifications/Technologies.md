Everything marked with star (*) is autogenerated and you don't have to worry about it.
Some important files:

 - `.gitignore`: File that says what is not goint to Git version control
 - `build.fsx`: Build script. This will be executed by `build.cmd` (Win) and `build.sh` (Mac/Linux)
 - `gulpfile.js`: Javascript task management
 - `paket.dependencies`: File that tells what to download from the internet. Paket will update `paket.lock` based on this and download the packages.
 - `*.fs`: Server side FSharp-programming language files. Compiled to exe-file.
  
## Technology based instructions ##

### MarkDown ###

This documentation are created in the MarkDown format. You can use e.g. [MarkdownPad 2](http://markdownpad.com/) on Windows to create markdown files. Basically markdown is just plain text files with some light formatting.

### Git ###

Git setup:

    git config --global user.name "Matti Meikalainen"
    git config --global user.email "matti.meikalainen@email.com"
    git config --global push.default simple

##### Basic Git commands: #####

- Get changes from the server: `git pull`
- Add files to git: `git add *`
- Check the status of files: `git status`
- Reset and delete all uncommited changes: `git reset --HARD`
- Delete all files that are not in the git repository: `git clean -xdf`
- Save files to local repository: `git commit -m "I did some modifications"`
- Send saved modifications to the server: `git push`

### Paket ###

Paket is a package management tool (a wrapper to NuGet) for multiple solutions. It can ensure that we have only one version of any NuGet-reference package.

Paket is located at ".paket"-folder (after running .paket\paket.bootstrapper.exe in the backend folder) and you can run it from the command line.

- Windows: `.paket\paket.exe`
- Mac/Linux: `mono .paket\paket.exe`

To get help just add --help to the parameters. To get more info what happens add --verbose parameter.

Paket uses three different files (which are just plain text files):

- `paket.references` tells what components a single project (.fsproj) uses (if projects are in use).
- `paket.dependencies` tells origins and all the components (and versions) that the whole application uses.
- `paket.lock` tells the reference trees: what component uses other and which versions. 

##### How to add new 3rd party component? #####

Add package name (from www.nuget.org) to `paket.dependencies`. Then run either:

- Windows: `.paket\paket.exe install`
- Mac/Linux: `mono .paket\paket.exe install`

This will automatically calculate you a new `paket.lock` file.

### F-Sharp ###

F-Sharp (F#) is the programming language.
Some learning references:

- Some synonyms for common code blocks [here](http://www.slideshare.net/fullscreen/thorium/possible-fsharp-refactorings-could-be/).
- Advanced [tutorial](https://thorium.github.io/FSharpAzure/Readme.html) to create a [cloud-web-app](https://github.com/Thorium/CatVsDog).
- Finnish F# tutorial, [part1](https://bitbucket.org/ilmirajat/fsharptraining.fi/src/be03cf26fd6c61f70ef5516172c06f59eaf224d2/FSharpTraining/01-Basics.fsx?at=master) and [part2](https://bitbucket.org/ilmirajat/fsharptraining.fi/src/be03cf26fd6c61f70ef5516172c06f59eaf224d2/FSharpTraining/04-MoreAdvancedStuff.fsx?at=master)
- [fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org/) and [English tutorial](http://www.tryfsharp.org/Learn).

#### TypeProviders ####

We use F# Data type providers to avoid complex O/R-mappings and domain models:

- [F# Data](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/)
- [SQLProvider](https://github.com/fsprojects/SQLProvider)
- [FSharp.Data.SqlClient](http://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Data.SqlClient/)

### OWIN ###

[Open Web Interface for .NET](http://owin.org/) is just a way to create a lightweight web-server.

### SignalR ###

[SignalR](http://signalr.net/) is a real-time communication library that can handle also push-based notifications from the server to the clients. It uses WebSockets and fallbacks to long-polling.

### Logary ###

[Logary] (https://logary.github.io/) is a logging library that makes it easy to integrate with many different "Operational Intelligence platforms" to gather real-time log data from distributed web-servers.

# Frontend #

This is just basic HTML-frontend.

We don't manage external JavaScript or stylesheet files in our code base: Files are listed to **Paket** just like in the server side. Files are fetched to paket-files folder and then build will copy these under frontend lib folder.

As in server side, **SignalR** is also used in client side. it makes it possible to call server side functions and also makes real-time communication via WebSocket or long-polling.

### Fonts ###

Current font has to be changed...

Fonts can be found from the [Google font site](https://www.google.com/fonts) and they can be converted to required formats via [FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).

### Gulp ###

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is client-side task manager. You can runit just as typing "gulp" into console. It is used as `gulpfile.js` describes:

 - Lint, aka. error-check Javascript files
 - Compile React.Js components to pure Javascript
 - Compile Less files to CSS-files.
 - Concatenate and minify CSS-files.
 - Concatenate external javascript libraries to single file to save http-requests and noise in html-header
 - Minify our Javascript files.
 - Create sourcemaps for debuging the minified files.
 - Watch changes to update dist-folder, which is the www-root for the web-server.

Gulp is used only on development-time environment.
It is fetched through npm (the Node.js package manager).

### React.Js ###

[React.Js](http://facebook.github.io/react/) is a tool we use for creating HTML-template-components that are used in a) multiple HTML-files, b) multiple times in a page, e.g. search result item.

React.Js components are files that have extension `*.jsx` and they are in the js-folder. Downside is that you have to write HTML to JavaScript, but there are no good options. All *VM-frameworks (Angular2, Knockout, Aurelia, etc) have their problems.

### Less / Sass ###

[Less](http://lesscss.org/) makes it possible to not repeat same html-colors etc. in the stylesheets:

- You can define e.g. @brand-color: #123456; and use the alias in css-style so you don't have to change everything when the color is changes, just manage it in one place.
- You can inherit styles to avoid repeating

Less-files are in the styles-folder and basically normal css-syntax is also valid less-syntax. There is a good tutorial on it's website.

If you prefer [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) over Less, just use it: it will also be parsed from the same styles-folder.

### Foundation.css ###

Zurb [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS is responsive stylesheet. It is used to make html layouts like:

- [Grid](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/grid.html): Responsive layout having 1-12 "columns" that are divided to multiple rows if the screen is too small.
- Vertical [Icon Bar](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/icon-bar.html) -menu
- [Pages](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/pagination.html) to list / search results
- [Thumbnail](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/thumbnails.html) images
- [Form](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/forms.html) layouts with [validations](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/abide.html)
- [Range sliders](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/range_slider.html)
- Radius [Buttons](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/buttons.html) and secondary buttons
- Vertical [Tabs](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/tabs.html#tabs-deeplink-3)
- ...and more.

Or if you want to rather use Twitter Bootstarp 4, you can just start writing its tags, as it is also included in the infrastructure.

### FontAwesome ###

To have icons in the user interface, we use [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon font. It has a [large collection](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) of vector graphic icons for user interface. They are used inside buttons, menus, etc. You use them like this: `<span class="fa fa-book"></span>`

### Lodash ###

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is a Javascript library to avoid writing loop-structures in Javascript. You shouldn't use for, while, or any other loop as they are not easy to undestand by just looking 3 sec to the source code. Instead you should use collection operators like `map`, `filter`, `reduce` and `each`.

    var filtered = _.filter(myCollection, function(i){ return i % 2 == 0; });
    var plusOnes = _.map(filtered, function(i){ return i + 1; });
    var sumTotal = _.reduce(plusOnes, function(a, k){ return a + k; });
    _.each(plusOnes, function(i){ alert(i); });

Undescore could be changed to Lodash or we could just use ES6. They are basically the same, the point is to write "what computer should do", not "how computer should do" it.

### jQuery and jQuery-UI ###

jQuery is an old library to manipulate HTML-objects via JavaScript: `$("#myId").doStuff();`
You should know this already. 

jQuery-UI is used for some themed components like the [datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/)-calendar.

### TypeScript ###

TypeScript is statically typed transpiler for JavaScript. It supports ES6. 
http://www.typescriptlang.org/

Browserify (in gulpfile.js) compiles TypeScript files starting from frontend/scripts/_references.d.ts (references to external modules) and frontend/scripts/app.ts (references to compiled *.ts files as modules). If you have errors, the JavaScript files under www-server folder (dist) may not update.

## Possible some more technologies if needed ##

You should use a reactive programming library like:

- [RX.js](http://reactivex.io/)
- [Bacon.js](https://baconjs.github.io/)

These will make it easy to write event-based code. Use events as infinite lists and code event based program state just as list operations.

Some kind of Javascript-side router may be taken into use for single-page-app:
e.g. [Crossroads.js](https://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/)

Other useful components:

- Web-testing: [canopy](http://lefthandedgoat.github.io/canopy/)
- Unit-testing: [FsUnit.xUnit](http://fsprojects.github.io/FsUnit/)
- Image-slider: [Slippry](http://slippry.com/)
- Localization-templates: [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/)
- File-upload: [JQuery File Uploader](https://github.com/danielm/uploader/)
- Chart-library: [Rickshaw](https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw)
- Maps: [Google Maps] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)

If you want to avoid pure JavaScript (or ES6) coding, then you should probably use one of these:

- [FunScript](http://funscript.info/)
- [ClojureScript + React.JS](http://reagent-project.github.io/)
- [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)
